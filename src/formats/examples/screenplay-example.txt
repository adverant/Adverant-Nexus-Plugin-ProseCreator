SCENE 1:

INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY

JANE enters the busy coffee shop, scanning the room for a familiar
face. She clutches her phone nervously, checking the time.

                         JANE
          Has anyone seen my laptop? I left
          it here fifteen minutes ago.

The BARISTA looks up from behind the counter.

                        BARISTA
               (apologetic)
          Sorry, I haven't seen anything.
          Have you checked with the manager?

JANE nods and heads toward the back of the shop.

                                                              CUT TO:

INT. COFFEE SHOP - MANAGER'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

JANE knocks on the door. The MANAGER, a middle-aged woman with kind
eyes, opens it.

                        MANAGER
          Can I help you?

                         JANE
          My laptop... I think someone took it.

                        MANAGER
               (concerned)
          Let me check our security footage.

The MANAGER turns to her computer screen.

                                                         FADE TO BLACK.
